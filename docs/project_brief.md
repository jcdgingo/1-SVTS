UTILS


Certainly, a "utils" folder is a great idea to store utility functions and helper code that can be used across different modules in your financial analytics system. Here are some possible utilities you can include in the "utils" folder:

1. **Data Cleaning Functions:** Functions to handle common data cleaning tasks like handling missing values, outlier detection, and data type conversions.

2. **Date and Time Utilities:** Functions for date and time manipulation, such as converting timestamps, calculating time intervals, and handling different date formats.

3. **Logging and Error Handling:** Code for logging system activities and handling errors gracefully.

4. **File I/O Functions:** Functions to read and write data to files in various formats, such as CSV, Excel, or JSON.

5. **Mathematical Functions:** Utility functions for mathematical operations that might be used in different parts of your system.

6. **Configuration Management:** Functions for loading and managing configuration settings for your modules.

7. **API Integration:** If you interact with external APIs, store functions for making API requests and handling responses.

8. **Plotting and Visualization Functions:** Utility functions to create common plots and visualizations for your analysis and reporting modules.

9. **Database Connection:** Code for connecting to and querying databases if you're storing data in a database.

10. **Security Functions:** Implement security-related utilities, such as encryption and decryption for sensitive data.

Remember that the specific utilities you need may vary depending on the requirements of your financial analytics system. You can continually add to and refine the utilities in the "utils" folder as your project progresses.



Certainly, here are some more suggestions for the types of utilities you can include in the "utils" folder for your financial analytics system:

11. **Email Notifications:** Functions for sending email notifications or alerts from your system.
12. **Data Serialization:** Code for serializing and deserializing data objects, especially useful for saving and loading machine learning models.
13. **Unit Testing Framework:** If you're developing a larger project, consider including a testing framework and utilities for unit testing your code.
14. **Parallel Processing:** Functions for parallelizing tasks to improve performance, especially when dealing with large datasets.
15. **Data Sampling and Resampling:** Utilities for random data sampling or resampling methods for balancing datasets.
16. **Normalization and Scaling:** Functions for data preprocessing like feature scaling and normalization.
17. **Model Evaluation Metrics:** Utilities to calculate and report common evaluation metrics for your machine learning models.
18. **Text Processing:** If you're dealing with text data, include text preprocessing and natural language processing (NLP) utilities.
19. **Web Scraping:** If you need to collect data from websites, create functions for web scraping and parsing HTML.
20. **Database Interaction:** Functions for interacting with databases, including creating, updating, and querying databases.
21. **API Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting mechanisms if you're making frequent API requests to avoid hitting rate limits.
22. **Time Series Analysis:** Utilities for time series analysis, including seasonality detection and trend analysis.
23. **Machine Learning Hyperparameter Tuning:** Functions for hyperparameter tuning and optimization of machine learning models.
24. **Data Visualization Themes:** If you have custom styling or themes for your visualizations, store them as utilities.

Remember that the utilities you include in the "utils" folder should be relevant to your project's needs. You can continually expand this folder as your project evolves and you identify more reusable code components.
